For solidity version 4.6.0, the following constraints exist:

1. You cannot return an array of elements in a function

2. You cannot return a struct in a function

3. You cannot pass a struct as an argument to a function

When a function returns a value, the ABI encoder returns a fixed length value.

Cannot have public mappings with variable length keys
